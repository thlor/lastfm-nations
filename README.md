Lastfm nations
=============
Last.fm nations was a widget to tell which nations’ music you listen to the most. You could embed it into your Last.fm profile.

It was an API based statistics script written in PHP. It parsed XML, drew graphics and used cron jobs and databases.

It gained more than 50,000 users and hundreds of thousands of views under four months – that’s when it became more than what my free hosting service could handle.
